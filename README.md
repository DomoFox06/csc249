# Hello, I'm Domonic Fox Yarnall 👋

## About Me
I am 19 years old and when I am not at school or home, I am usually invlolved in the church community on Fort Bragg where I will help with various functions and help teach the second graders.

## My Foo 🎯
In my spare time I like to read and play games. I have been into reading Disney's Twisted Tales and various mangas. The last manga I read was Drangon Ball Z, which I am a fan of. It is a very good series so I started watching the Dragon Ball anime. I plan on reading the manga Tokyo Ghoul next. I hear good things about it. I like to play pretty much any Mario game. I feel I'm pretty good at Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 7 🏎 and I am always down for any of the Mario Party games, but my favoite mario games would be the Luigi's Mansion series 👻 . Looking forward to when a fourth one is made 😁🤞

## Currently Learning
I am currently striving for my associates of science, but am majoring in Computer Science. I am pretty open to any job Computer Science can get, but I want one where I get to build things. Cybersecurity seems like a could work field where I can do that in. This semester I have Biology, Math, Java, and this class, Data Structure, where I look forward to learning:

- 🤖 AI collaboration and prompt engineering
- 🐙 GitHub workflows and version control
- 💡 Building my first AI assistants

## Fun Fact
A fun fact about myself would be that when I was about 3 and 4 years old, I lived in Japan and started learning Japenese before English, but now I only know English.
